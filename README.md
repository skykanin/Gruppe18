# IT1901 project for group 18
This is the repository for group 18's solution to the project. The general task was for us to make an application so that several different kinds of users i.e. booking managers, band managers and techicians could organize and plan for the concerts that were taking place under the [UKA-17](https://www.uka.no/) festival.

## Download from source
We used [electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to create this app so if you want to download this application you need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Follow installation instructions on their website if you don't already have node.

To use the application you can clone this repository by using this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/skykanin/Gruppe18.git
```
Once you are inside the directory use the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies and `npm start` to launch the application.

It is important to note that you have to be connected to [NTNU's](https://www.ntnu.no/) network via their Wi-Fi or VPN in order for this application to work since the database is only accessible on their network.
